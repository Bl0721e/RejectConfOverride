# [obsolete]RejectConfOverride

This is now obsolete. You can achieve same effect with the new Config.txt.

A simple plugin for OpenMod/Unturned<br/>
It will prevent Config.json being overridden when you load a map that changes your game config.
Can be useful if you want to enable on vehicle building on some maps that doesnt allow you to like Arid or Buak.
